\section*{Exercise 1.3.14}

This is my solution to the first exercise. I can write mathematical expressions inline, e.g.~$p \land q$, or I can write them on separate lines
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:1}
  (p \lor q) \land (\lnot p \lor r) \rightarrow (q \lor r) .
\end{equation}
I can refer to equations in the text, e.g.~equation~\eqref{eq:1}, but I can also have equations without number, such as
\begin{equation*}
  P(A | B) = \frac{P(B | A) P(A)}{P(B)} ,
\end{equation*}
for $P(B) > 0$.
\section*{Exercise 1.4.20}
For a short document like this, it looks best not to have numbers on my section titles. I can do this using \verb+\section*+. However, if I am writing a longer report I might have numbered section using \verb+\section+.

\begin{enumerate}
\item This is my solution to question a.
\item This is my solution to question b.
\item This is my solution to question c.
\item This is my solution to question d.
\item This is my solution to question e.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Exercise 1.5.10}

\begin{enumerate}
\item This is my solution to question a.
\item This is my solution to question b.
\item This is my solution to question c.
\item This is my solution to question d.
\end{enumerate}
