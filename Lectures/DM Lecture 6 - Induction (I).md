# DM Lecture 6 - Induction

## Readings
- [[Discrete Mathematics (book).pdf]]
	- [ ] 5.2 - 5.4 (you only need to skim "The Well-Ordering Principle for the Integers" in Chapter 5.4)
    - [ ] 5.5 is _optional_ (read it if you want to know about applications of induction)

- Supplemental reading
	- [ ] The super curious student might ask, where does induction come from?It is a theorem, that follows from an axiom in [ZFC (modern set theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory#7._Axiom_of_infinity) - the Axiom of infinity.
	- [ ] The "[All horses are same color" falsification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_horses_are_the_same_color)
